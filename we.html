  <h1> The Life of Six Cats <h1>
  <div style="background-color:pink;color:white;padding;20px;">
     <p id="p1"> I have six cats. Two kittens that are my babies and are seven months old.
    Their names are Luna and Minerva. Luna is a pure white kitten that does not
    like any humans except for her mom (me). Minerva, who we call Minnie is a pure
    black kitten who is very playful and loves to cuddle with others. Minnie used
    to have a brother kitten named Severus who unfortuanatly got sick and died.
    One of our cats is three years old and never comes in the house but loves
    to sit on top of cars, her name is Ella, short for Cinderella. Cinderella
    is a grey cat with a white tummy and white patterns on her ears. The other
    three cats are foster cats, two of them are kittens and the other one is
    their mom who we call Feral Mommy, because she is feral so she hisses at all
    humans. Her to kittens however, are adorable and love human contact, their
    names are Anchovie and Sardine. Anchovie is a super small female kitten who
    is pretty timid but loves playing with her brother and sleeping on warm
    surfaces such as peoples legs. Sardine however is bigger than his sister and
    loves playing with everything and exploring everywhere he can. The three
    foster cats are tuxedo cats, so they have black fur with white stomachs.
    These are all my fur babies so come check out my crib. </p>
